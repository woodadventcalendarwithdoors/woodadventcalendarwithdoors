In this article, we will provide you with a decision calendar for college applications in 2024. This calendar will guide you through each step of the application process and help you stay on track with important deadlines.<\/p>\n<h2>When Should I Start Preparing for College Applications?<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s never too early to start preparing for college applications. Ideally, you should start preparing during your junior year of high school. This will give you enough time to research colleges, take standardized tests, and develop your application materials.<\/p>\n<h3>What Standardized Tests Do I Need to Take?<\/h3>\n<p>Most colleges require applicants to submit either SAT or ACT scores. Some colleges may also require SAT Subject Tests or AP exams. It&#8217;s important to research each college&#8217;s requirements to make sure you are taking the appropriate tests.<\/p>\n<h2>When Should I Start Applying to Colleges?<\/h2>\n<p>The college application process typically starts in the summer or fall of your senior year of high school. It&#8217;s important to research each college&#8217;s application deadlines and make a plan to submit your applications on time.<\/p>\n<h3>Do I Need to Apply Early Decision or Early Action?<\/h3>\n<p>Early decision and early action are two types of early application options offered by some colleges. Early decision is binding, meaning that if you are accepted, you are required to attend that college. Early action is non-binding, meaning that you are not committed to attending that college if you are accepted. It&#8217;s important to research each college&#8217;s early application options and make a decision based on your personal circumstances.<\/p>\n<h2>What Should I Include in My College Application?<\/h2>\n<p>Your college application should include your transcripts, standardized test scores, essays, recommendation letters, and any other supplemental materials required by the college. It&#8217;s important to review each college&#8217;s application requirements and make sure you are submitting all necessary materials.<\/p>\n<h3>How Should I Choose Which Colleges to Apply To?<\/h3>\n<p>Choosing which colleges to apply to can be overwhelming. It&#8217;s important to research each college&#8217;s academic programs, location, campus culture, and financial aid options. You should also consider your personal preferences and goals when making your decision.<\/p>\n<h2>What Should I Do After Submitting My College Applications?<\/h2>\n<p>After submitting your college applications, you should continue to research and visit colleges, apply for financial aid, and make a decision about where you will attend college. It&#8217;s important to stay organized and on top of important deadlines throughout the entire process.<\/p>\n<h3>What Should I Do If I&#8217;m Waitlisted or Rejected?<\/h3>\n<p>If you are waitlisted or rejected from a college, it&#8217;s important to remember that it&#8217;s not the end of the world. You can always apply to other colleges or take a gap year to gain more experience and reapply in the future. It&#8217;s important to stay positive and keep your options open.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Applying to colleges can be a stressful process, but with the right resources and information, it can also be an exciting and rewarding experience. Use this decision calendar to guide you through each step of the application process and remember to stay organized and on top of important deadlines. Good luck!<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"College Decision Reveal 2020 YouTube\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/sd6_eOAfiCA\/maxresdefault.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.youtube.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Official Class of 2025 Decision Dates Calendar ApplyingToCollege\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/external-preview.redd.it\/59cmv88WaZxxahOlkpUG9ptjLxaqFsVbUJEhTt_1Fko.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=5d370243f603a2fba41bedce54f221f3f3c518c1\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.reddit.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"A Calendar Of Jewish Holidays Jewish holidays, Jewish holiday\" src=\"https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/736x\/89\/da\/9c\/89da9c32605ca5f98ae8bd6792cf84ee.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.pinterest.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"UCF Class of 2024 National College Decision Day YouTube\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Vd44oCsYCWE\/maxresdefault.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.youtube.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Penn&#039;s early decision acceptance rate increases to 19.7 for Class of\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/snworksceo.imgix.net\/dpn\/853ce046-f024-4ce0-b421-c4ab9713a5b0.sized-1000x1000.png?w=1000\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.thedp.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"COLLEGE DECISION REVEAL YouTube\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JLVYcnO8JU0\/maxresdefault.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.youtube.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"My college decision reaction 2020 \ud83d\ude31 ( \u2026... class of 2024) YouTube\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/3x9GF3hpEaU\/maxresdefault.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.youtube.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"College Decision Day Class of 2020 YouTube\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/KJ-nabaAQyk\/maxresdefault.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.youtube.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Official Class of 2025 Decision Dates Calendar ApplyingToCollege from www.reddit.com Introduction Applying to colleges can be a daunting task, but with the right resources and information, it&#8230; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/78"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=78"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/78\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=78"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
