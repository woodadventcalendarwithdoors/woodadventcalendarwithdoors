This annual event offers a new tank every day in December, giving players the chance to expand their collection and try out new vehicles. But what can we expect from next year&#8217;s advent calendar? In this article, we&#8217;ll take a look at some of the rumors and predictions surrounding the event, as well as some tips for making the most of your advent calendar experience.<\/p>\n<h2>What Tanks Will Be Included?<\/h2>\n<p>One of the biggest questions surrounding the advent calendar is what tanks will be included. While Wargaming, the creators of World of Tanks, have not yet released an official list, there are several theories floating around. Some players believe that the advent calendar will feature brand new tanks that have never been released before, while others predict that we&#8217;ll see a mix of old and new vehicles. There are also rumors that the advent calendar will include rare tanks that are no longer available for purchase, making it a must-have for collectors.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: Will the Advent Calendar Include Premium Tanks?<\/h3>\n<p>A: Yes, the advent calendar typically includes a mix of premium and non-premium tanks. Premium tanks are vehicles that can be purchased with real money and offer benefits such as increased credit and experience earnings.<\/p>\n<h2>How Much Will It Cost?<\/h2>\n<p>Another big question is how much the advent calendar will cost. In previous years, the calendar has typically been priced at around $25-30 USD, but some players are hoping for a lower cost this time around. It&#8217;s also possible that the advent calendar will be available for purchase with in-game currency, although this has not yet been confirmed.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: Can I Purchase the Advent Calendar with Gold?<\/h3>\n<p>A: It&#8217;s possible that the advent calendar will be available for purchase with gold, but this has not yet been confirmed. Keep an eye on the official World of Tanks website for updates on pricing and payment options.<\/p>\n<h2>Tips for Making the Most of Your Advent Calendar Experience<\/h2>\n<p>Whether this is your first advent calendar or you&#8217;re a seasoned veteran, there are a few tips that can help you make the most of the event:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Plan ahead: Take a look at the list of tanks that will be included and figure out which ones you&#8217;re most interested in. This will help you prioritize your purchases and make sure you don&#8217;t miss out on anything.<\/li>\n<li>Set a budget: It&#8217;s easy to get carried away during the advent calendar, so make sure you set a budget and stick to it. This will help you avoid overspending and ensure that you have enough money left over for other in-game purchases.<\/li>\n<li>Check the deals: In addition to the daily tanks, the advent calendar typically includes other deals and discounts. Make sure you check these out to see if there are any other items you want to purchase.<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t forget about equipment: While the tanks are the main attraction, don&#8217;t forget about the equipment that comes with them. Make sure you have enough credits and garage slots to accommodate all of your new vehicles.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The World of Tanks advent calendar is always an exciting event for players, and next year&#8217;s calendar is sure to be no exception. While we don&#8217;t know all the details yet, there are plenty of rumors and predictions to keep us excited. Just remember to plan ahead, set a budget, and have fun!<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Advent Calendar Full List and last update General Discussion World\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/i.imgur.com\/Q0xvXCT.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>forum.worldoftanks.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"World of Tanks Advent Calendar 2020 day 24 last gold offer\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.mmowg.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Sx4vwi5009k.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.mmowg.net<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"[WoT\u65b0\u95fb] 2020 \u964d\u4e34\u5386\uff1a\u51ac\u5b63\u5927\u7279\u5356\u6b63\u5f0f\u5230\u6765\uff01 NGA\u73a9\u5bb6\u793e\u533a\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/sg-wotp.wgcdn.co\/dcont\/fb\/image\/advent_calendar_screenshot_(1).png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>ngabbs.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"World Of Tanks Advent Calendar Code Outlook Calendar 2022\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.mmowg.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Cattura-10.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>malcolmweaver.blogspot.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Remember to check the advent calendar popup for a daily mission\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/external-preview.redd.it\/l4jCsOTOmi5Z79lvfrRE43Rl3AOE_BuaBH1H4-m8MXo.png?auto=webp&amp;s=09c50304937119aba6819257eaa1ebed17e4a5f5\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.reddit.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"World of Tanks Advent Calendar day 4\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.mmowg.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Cattura21.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.mmowg.net<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Wot Eu Advent Calendar Academy Calendar 2022\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.mmowg.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Cattura-19.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>jacksonhaleruiz.blogspot.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"WOT Advent Calendar Advice Beware!
