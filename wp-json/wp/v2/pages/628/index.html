It weighs around 24 tons and is 11 feet in diameter.<\/p>\n<p>The stone represents the Aztec calendar and was used to track the cycles of the sun and the moon. It was also used to mark important events such as the equinoxes and solstices.<\/p>\n<p>Many people believe that the Aztec Sun Stone has mystical powers and can predict the future. However, this is not true. The stone is simply a tool that was used by the Aztecs to track time.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the significance of the Aztec Sun Stone?<\/h3>\n<p>The Aztec Sun Stone is significant because it represents the Aztec calendar and the way that the Aztecs measured time. It also provides insight into the religious beliefs and practices of the Aztecs.<\/p>\n<h3>How does the Aztec Sun Stone compare to the Mayan Calendar?<\/h3>\n<p>The Aztec Sun Stone is similar to the Mayan Calendar in that they both track the cycles of the sun and the moon. However, the Mayan Calendar is more complex and is based on a system of cycles that are much longer than those used by the Aztecs.<\/p>\n<h2>The Mayan Calendar<\/h2>\n<p>The Mayan Calendar is a system of calendars that was used by the Maya civilization in Mesoamerica. It is made up of several different calendars that track different cycles of time.<\/p>\n<p>The most famous of these calendars is the Long Count calendar, which is based on cycles of 20 and 13. This calendar was used to track time over long periods, and it is this calendar that has led to the belief that the world will end in 2012.<\/p>\n<p>However, this belief is not accurate. The Mayan Calendar does not predict the end of the world. Instead, it is simply a tool that was used by the Maya to track time.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the significance of the Mayan Calendar?<\/h3>\n<p>The Mayan Calendar is significant because it provides insight into the way that the Maya measured time. It also reflects the religious beliefs and practices of the Maya.<\/p>\n<h3>How does the Mayan Calendar compare to the Aztec Sun Stone?<\/h3>\n<p>The Mayan Calendar is more complex than the Aztec Sun Stone and is based on longer cycles of time. However, both systems were used to track the cycles of the sun and the moon, and both reflect the religious beliefs and practices of their respective civilizations.<\/p>\n<h2>Aztec Sun Stone vs Mayan Calendar 2024<\/h2>\n<p>As we approach the year 2024, many people are wondering what significance the Aztec Sun Stone and the Mayan Calendar will have. Will they predict something important?<\/p>\n<p>The truth is that neither the Aztec Sun Stone nor the Mayan Calendar can predict the future. They are simply tools that were used by ancient civilizations to track time. However, they do provide insight into the religious beliefs and practices of these civilizations.<\/p>\n<p>As we approach 2024, it is important to remember that the Aztec Sun Stone and the Mayan Calendar are not mystical objects that can predict the future. They are simply artifacts that provide a glimpse into the past.<\/p>\n<h3>Will the world end in 2024?<\/h3>\n<p>No, the world will not end in 2024. This is simply a myth that has been perpetuated by people who do not understand the Mayan Calendar or the Aztec Sun Stone.<\/p>\n<h3>What can we learn from the Aztec Sun Stone and the Mayan Calendar?<\/h3>\n<p>We can learn a lot from the Aztec Sun Stone and the Mayan Calendar. They provide insight into the way that ancient civilizations measured time and the religious beliefs and practices of these civilizations.<\/p>\n<p>They also remind us that the world is constantly changing and that we should respect the beliefs and practices of other cultures.<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>The Aztec Sun Stone and the Mayan Calendar are both significant artifacts that provide insight into the way that ancient civilizations measured time. As we approach 2024, it is important to remember that these artifacts cannot predict the future.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, they remind us of the importance of respecting the beliefs and practices of other cultures and of the constant change that is a part of life.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Aztec Mayan Calendar Stone Wall Plaque Sun Stone Home or Etsy\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/i.etsystatic.com\/11205948\/r\/il\/4a3e52\/1291901846\/il_1588xN.1291901846_1syj.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.etsy.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Aztec Mayan Calendar stone wall plaque Sun Stone home or Etsy\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/i.etsystatic.com\/11205948\/r\/il\/4e186c\/1291900278\/il_fullxfull.1291900278_kv4j.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.etsy.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Aztec Mayan Calendar Stone Wall Plaque Sun Stone Home or Etsy\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/i.etsystatic.com\/11205948\/r\/il\/464b32\/1339149041\/il_1140xN.1339149041_l1z2.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.etsy.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Aztec stone of the sun calendar Maya Mayan Mexico Museum Stock Photo\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/c8.alamy.com\/comp\/AM07MK\/aztec-stone-of-the-sun-calendar-maya-mayan-mexico-museum-AM07MK.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.alamy.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Mayan Calendar Sculpture Aztec Calendar Aztec Sun Stone Etsy UK\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/i.etsystatic.com\/29095113\/r\/il\/2b5642\/3081665780\/il_1140xN.3081665780_tk8a.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.etsy.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Aztec Mayan Calendar Stone Wall Plaque Sun Stone Home or Etsy UK\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/i.etsystatic.com\/11205948\/r\/il\/a3fdc2\/1291899710\/il_570xN.1291899710_fyrh.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.etsy.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Aztec Mayan Calendar Stone Wall Plaque Sun Stone Home or Etsy\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/i.etsystatic.com\/11205948\/r\/il\/f56be7\/1291900770\/il_794xN.1291900770_4cta.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.etsy.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Aztec calendar Stone of the Sun Aztec calendar, Mayan calendar, Mayan art\" src=\"https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/4b\/1c\/6b\/4b1c6bfdba937fec16dcbda3140f92c9.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.pinterest.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Aztec Mayan Calendar Stone Wall Plaque Sun Stone Home or Etsy UK from www.etsy.com The Aztec Sun Stone The Aztec Sun Stone, also known as the Aztec&#8230; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/628"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=628"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/628\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=628"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
