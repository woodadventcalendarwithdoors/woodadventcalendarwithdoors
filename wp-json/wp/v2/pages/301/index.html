The liturgical calendar is divided into several seasons, each with its own set of themes and celebrations. In this article, we will be discussing the United Methodist Church liturgical calendar for the year 2024. <\/p>\n<h2>The Seasons of the Liturgical Calendar<\/h2>\n<p> The United Methodist Church liturgical calendar is divided into six seasons. These seasons are Advent, Christmas, Epiphany, Lent, Easter, and Ordinary Time. Each season has its own unique set of themes and celebrations. <\/p>\n<h3>Advent<\/h3>\n<p> Advent is the season that begins four weeks before Christmas. It is a time of preparation and waiting for the birth of Jesus. During this season, many churches light Advent candles and hold special services. <\/p>\n<h3>Christmas<\/h3>\n<p> Christmas is the season that celebrates the birth of Jesus. It begins on December 25th and lasts for 12 days. During this season, many churches hold special services and sing Christmas carols. <\/p>\n<h3>Epiphany<\/h3>\n<p> Epiphany is the season that celebrates the visit of the Magi to the baby Jesus. It begins on January 6th and lasts until the beginning of Lent. During this season, many churches hold special services and sing hymns about the visit of the Magi. <\/p>\n<h3>Lent<\/h3>\n<p> Lent is the season that begins on Ash Wednesday and lasts for 40 days. It is a time of repentance and reflection in preparation for Easter. During this season, many churches hold special services and many Christians give up something for Lent as a form of sacrifice. <\/p>\n<h3>Easter<\/h3>\n<p> Easter is the season that celebrates the resurrection of Jesus. It begins on Easter Sunday and lasts for 50 days. During this season, many churches hold special services and sing hymns about the resurrection of Jesus. <\/p>\n<h3>Ordinary Time<\/h3>\n<p> Ordinary Time is the season that falls between Easter and Advent.
