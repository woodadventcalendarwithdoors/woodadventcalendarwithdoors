One of its key features is the ability to view calendars within the app, which makes scheduling meetings and appointments much easier. But what if you need to see someone else&#8217;s calendar in Teams? Here&#8217;s how you can do it.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 1: Add the Person to Your Contacts<\/h2>\n<p>In order to view someone else&#8217;s calendar in Teams, you&#8217;ll first need to add them to your contacts list. To do this, simply search for their name in the search bar at the top of the Teams app and click on &#8220;Add Contact&#8221; next to their name. Once you&#8217;ve done this, they&#8217;ll appear in your contacts list.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 2: Ask for Permission<\/h2>\n<p>Before you can view someone else&#8217;s calendar in Teams, you need to ask for their permission. This is important for privacy and security reasons. To do this, simply send them a message in Teams asking if you can view their calendar. They&#8217;ll then need to grant you permission.<\/p>\n<h3>Question: What if the person doesn&#8217;t want to give me permission?<\/h3>\n<p>If the person doesn&#8217;t want to give you permission to view their calendar, there&#8217;s not much you can do. You&#8217;ll need to respect their privacy and find another way to schedule meetings and appointments.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 3: View the Calendar<\/h2>\n<p>Once the person has given you permission to view their calendar, you can easily do so in Teams. Simply click on their name in your contacts list and then click on the &#8220;Calendar&#8221; tab. You&#8217;ll then be able to see their calendar and schedule meetings and appointments accordingly.<\/p>\n<h3>Question: Can I edit the person&#8217;s calendar?<\/h3>\n<p>No, you can&#8217;t edit someone else&#8217;s calendar in Teams. You can only view it and schedule meetings and appointments.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 4: Remove Access<\/h2>\n<p>If you no longer need to view someone else&#8217;s calendar in Teams, you can easily remove access. Simply click on their name in your contacts list, click on the &#8220;More Options&#8221; icon, and then click on &#8220;Remove Contact&#8221;. This will remove them from your contacts list and revoke your access to their calendar.<\/p>\n<h3>Question: Can the person see that I&#8217;m viewing their calendar?<\/h3>\n<p>No, the person won&#8217;t be notified when you view their calendar in Teams. However, they&#8217;ll be able to see that you&#8217;ve scheduled a meeting or appointment with them.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Viewing someone else&#8217;s calendar in Teams is a useful feature that can make scheduling meetings and appointments much easier. However, it&#8217;s important to ask for permission and respect people&#8217;s privacy. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can easily view someone else&#8217;s calendar in Teams and improve your collaboration efforts.<\/p>\n<p><\/body><\/html><\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Teams Calendar &amp; Calls Here&#039;s how to run meetings on Microsoft Teams\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.ingenious.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Teams-Calendar-1024x714-1.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.ingenious.co.uk<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Teamup Calendar Templates HQ Printable Documents\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/confluence.atlassian.com\/teamcal\/files\/241566246\/776658017\/5\/1524193366615\/myCalendars.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>whoamuu.blogspot.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Getting Started with Microsoft Teams Shifts (2022)\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/adamtheautomator.com\/content\/images\/2020\/05\/approve-timeoff.gif\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>thapon.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How To View Someone Else&#039;s Calendar In Outlook 2016 \/ How Do I Share\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/proxy\/Gu_eCJtHSR0V8MMCsaMLd5EYHjPMbjJjhRRZxCAJivyGTAQJnd7OIyhbfAgu7NR-q-slw-gx0ifI-taeKhlPMIYmnvkJf6DJeDBoijWpmYtky2tBamXPqAXcW6FrwDaJqUDZyxnQbmU=w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>pearlatudeas.blogspot.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How Can I View Other Team Members\u2019 Schedules on My Calendar?\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/support.jobnimbus.com\/hs-fs\/hubfs\/Support - Knowledge Base\/Knowledge Base Import\/Calendar\/v2 calendar view team members.png?width=341&amp;name=v2 calendar view team members.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>support.jobnimbus.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Microsoft Teams User Manual for Remote Workers (2022)\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.proserveit.com\/hs-fs\/hubfs\/00 calendar.jpg?width=600&amp;name=00 calendar.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>thapon.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"using calendar in microsoft teams shopmall.my\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/blog.virtosoftware.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/CalendarTeams019.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>shopmall.my<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Team Up!
