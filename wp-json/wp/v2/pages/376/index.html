This method is based on the mother&#8217;s age at the time of conception and the lunar month of conception. The Chinese believe that the gender of a baby is determined by the mother&#8217;s age and the lunar month of conception.<\/p>\n<p>The Chinese Calendar Baby Gender Prediction Method is said to be 90% accurate, and many parents-to-be swear by it. But is there any scientific basis for this method? The answer is no. There is no scientific evidence to support the accuracy of this method.<\/p>\n<h3>How to Use the Chinese Calendar Baby Gender Prediction Method<\/h3>\n<p>To use the Chinese Calendar Baby Gender Prediction Method, you need to know the mother&#8217;s age at the time of conception and the lunar month of conception. You can find a Chinese Gender Prediction Chart online or in a book.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have the chart, locate the mother&#8217;s age at the time of conception on the left-hand side of the chart and the lunar month of conception along the top of the chart. The point where the age and month intersect will reveal the gender of the baby.<\/p>\n<h3>Question and Answer<\/h3>\n<p>Q: Is the Chinese Calendar Baby Gender Prediction Method accurate?<\/p>\n<p>A: There is no scientific evidence to support the accuracy of this method.
