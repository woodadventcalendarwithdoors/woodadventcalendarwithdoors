However, there may be times when you need to block off certain dates on your calendar. In this article, we will show you how to unblock your Airbnb calendar for the year 2024.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Would You Need to Unblock Your Airbnb Calendar?<\/h2>\n<p>There are several reasons why you may need to unblock your Airbnb calendar. For example, you may have blocked off certain dates because you were planning to use your property for personal reasons, such as a family vacation. Alternatively, you may have had a long-term booking that has now been cancelled, and you need to make those dates available for new bookings.<\/p>\n<h3>Question:<\/h3>\n<p>How do I know if my Airbnb calendar is blocked?<\/p>\n<h3>Answer:<\/h3>\n<p>If your calendar is blocked, the dates will be shaded in red. You will not be able to receive bookings for those dates until you unblock them.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Unblock Your Airbnb Calendar<\/h2>\n<p>To unblock your Airbnb calendar, follow these steps:<\/p>\n<h3>Step 1: Log in to Your Airbnb Account<\/h3>\n<p>Go to the Airbnb website and log in to your account. Click on the &#8220;Calendar&#8221; tab to view your calendar.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 2: Select the Dates You Want to Unblock<\/h3>\n<p>Click on the dates that you want to unblock. They will be highlighted in red.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 3: Click on &#8220;Availability&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p>Click on the &#8220;Availability&#8221; button that appears at the bottom of the calendar.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 4: Choose Your Availability Settings<\/h3>\n<p>You will be able to choose from three options:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Open&#8221;: This means that your property is available for bookings on those dates.<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Closed&#8221;: This means that your property is not available for bookings on those dates.<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Preferential&#8221;: This means that you will give priority to certain guests, such as those who have stayed with you before.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Step 5: Save Your Changes<\/h3>\n<p>Click on the &#8220;Save&#8221; button to save your changes. Your calendar will now be updated to reflect your new availability settings.<\/p>\n<h3>Question:<\/h3>\n<p>Can I unblock my Airbnb calendar for specific times of the day?<\/p>\n<h3>Answer:<\/h3>\n<p>No, you can only unblock your calendar for entire days. However, you can set different availability settings for different dates. For example, you can set some dates to &#8220;Open&#8221; and others to &#8220;Preferential&#8221;.<\/p>\n<h2>Tips for Managing Your Airbnb Calendar<\/h2>\n<p>Here are some tips to help you manage your Airbnb calendar:<\/p>\n<h3>Tip 1: Keep Your Calendar Up to Date<\/h3>\n<p>Make sure that your calendar is always up to date to avoid double bookings and to ensure that your guests have a smooth booking experience.<\/p>\n<h3>Tip 2: Block Off Time for Cleaning<\/h3>\n<p>Block off time on your calendar for cleaning between guests. This will give you enough time to prepare your property for the next guests.<\/p>\n<h3>Tip 3: Use the Airbnb Calendar Sync<\/h3>\n<p>If you list your property on multiple booking platforms, use the Airbnb Calendar Sync to keep all of your calendars up to date.<\/p>\n<h3>Tip 4: Don&#8217;t Overbook Your Property<\/h3>\n<p>Be careful not to overbook your property. Only accept bookings that you can realistically accommodate.<\/p>\n<h3>Question:<\/h3>\n<p>What should I do if I accidentally accept a booking for a date that is blocked on my calendar?<\/p>\n<h3>Answer:<\/h3>\n<p>Contact the guest as soon as possible and explain the situation. Offer to refund their booking or to find them alternative accommodation.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Unblocking your Airbnb calendar is a simple process that can be done in just a few steps. By keeping your calendar up to date and following these tips, you can ensure that your guests have a smooth booking experience and that your property is always ready for new guests.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Urgent HA \/ TA calendar sync ignores airbnb block dates?
