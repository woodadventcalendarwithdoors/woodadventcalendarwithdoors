However, the recruiting process can be daunting, and it&#8217;s important to understand the rules and regulations set forth by the NCAA. In this article, we will discuss the NCAA Softball Recruiting Calendar for 2024-2025 and answer some common questions about the process.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the NCAA Softball Recruiting Calendar?<\/h3>\n<p>The NCAA Softball Recruiting Calendar outlines the dates and rules for the recruiting process. It is divided into four periods: Quiet Period, Dead Period, Contact Period, and Evaluation Period. During each period, coaches and players have different restrictions and allowances for communication and visits.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the Quiet Period?<\/h3>\n<p>The Quiet Period is a time when coaches can communicate with players, but not in-person. They can still make phone calls, emails, and social media contact. However, they cannot visit the player&#8217;s school or attend their games. This period typically occurs during the summer and fall months.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the Dead Period?<\/h3>\n<p>The Dead Period is a time when coaches cannot have any contact with players. This includes phone calls, emails, and in-person visits. The only exception is if the player visits the campus on their own accord. This period typically occurs during the NCAA tournament and holiday season.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the Contact Period?<\/h3>\n<p>The Contact Period is a time when coaches can have in-person contact with players. They can attend their games, visit their schools, and have official or unofficial visits on campus. Coaches can still communicate through phone, email, and social media. This period typically occurs during the spring and summer months.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the Evaluation Period?<\/h3>\n<p>The Evaluation Period is a time when coaches can watch players compete in-person. They can attend high school games, tournaments, and showcases. They cannot have any in-person communication with players or their families, but can still communicate through phone, email, and social media. This period typically occurs during the fall and spring months.<\/p>\n<h2>FAQs<\/h2>\n<h3>When can coaches start contacting players?<\/h3>\n<p>Coaches can start contacting players on September 1 of their junior year in high school.<\/p>\n<h3>Can players contact coaches before September 1 of their junior year?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, players can contact coaches at any time. However, coaches cannot respond until September 1 of their junior year.<\/p>\n<h3>Can players take official visits during the Quiet Period?<\/h3>\n<p>No, players cannot take official visits during the Quiet Period. However, they can still take unofficial visits and communicate with coaches through phone, email, and social media.<\/p>\n<h3>How many official visits can players take?<\/h3>\n<p>Players are allowed to take up to five official visits to different schools.<\/p>\n<h3>Can players commit to a school before their senior year?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, players can commit to a school at any time. However, they cannot sign a National Letter of Intent until the signing period in their senior year.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The NCAA Softball Recruiting Calendar can be confusing, but it&#8217;s important for players and their families to understand the rules and regulations. By knowing the different periods and restrictions, players can maximize their opportunities and find the right fit for them. Good luck to all the aspiring college softball players out there!<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"WBSC launches new Softball World Cup format, 20212029 global schedule\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/asiasoftball.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/8652112b-0fdb-df55-6204-faa8f5930c82.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>asiasoftball.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Academic Calendars 2024\/2025 Free Printable PDF templates\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.calendarpedia.com\/images-large\/academic\/2024-2025-academic-calendar.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.calendarpedia.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Coaches\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cdn4.sportngin.com\/attachments\/photo\/b353-134497283\/2019_recruiting_calander_large.PNG\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.txglory.net<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"News Pittsburgh Power Softball\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.pittsburghpowersoftball.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/2020_NCAA_recruiting_calendar-741x1024.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.pittsburghpowersoftball.org<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"20242025 Proposed\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/apps.weber.edu\/wsuimages\/registrar\/pictures\/2024-2025 Academic Calendar(1).png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.weber.edu<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Academic Calendars 2024\/2025 Free Printable PDF templates\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.calendarpedia.com\/images-large\/academic\/2024-2025-academic-calendar-rolling.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.calendarpedia.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"20242025 Two Year Calendar Free Printable Word Templates\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.calendarpedia.com\/images-large\/two-year\/2024-2025-calendar-portrait.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.calendarpedia.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"96 best ideas for coloring Ncaa Basketball Rankings 2022 2023\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/i.imgur.com\/T4PFfpN.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.stockicons.info<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>20242025 Two Year Calendar Free Printable Word Templates from www.calendarpedia.com Introduction Softball is a popular sport in the United States, and many high school students dream of&#8230; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/430"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=430"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/430\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=430"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
