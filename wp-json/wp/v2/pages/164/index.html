The NCAA updates the recruiting calendar every year to ensure that it reflects the latest changes in college sports. In this article, we will discuss the NCAA recruiting calendar for the 2024-2025 academic year.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the NCAA Recruiting Calendar?<\/h2>\n<p>The NCAA recruiting calendar outlines the specific dates and timelines for when college coaches can communicate with prospective student-athletes about recruitment. The calendar is designed to ensure that college coaches and student-athletes follow a fair and transparent process when it comes to recruitment.<\/p>\n<h2>When Does the Recruiting Process Start?<\/h2>\n<p>The recruiting process for college sports typically starts during a student-athlete&#8217;s sophomore or junior year of high school. However, it&#8217;s important to note that the NCAA has strict rules on when college coaches can communicate with prospective student-athletes.<\/p>\n<h2>What Are the Recruiting Periods?<\/h2>\n<p>The recruiting calendar is broken down into specific periods when college coaches can communicate with prospective student-athletes. These periods include the contact period, evaluation period, and quiet period.<\/p>\n<h3>Contact Period<\/h3>\n<p>The contact period is when college coaches can have in-person contact with prospective student-athletes and their families. During this period, coaches can also make phone calls, send text messages, and send emails to student-athletes.<\/p>\n<h3>Evaluation Period<\/h3>\n<p>The evaluation period is when college coaches can watch prospective student-athletes compete in their sport. Coaches can also visit high schools and attend tournaments during this period.<\/p>\n<h3>Quiet Period<\/h3>\n<p>The quiet period is when college coaches can&#8217;t have in-person contact with prospective student-athletes off the college campus. However, coaches can still communicate through phone calls, text messages, and emails.<\/p>\n<h2>When Does the Recruiting Process End?<\/h2>\n<p>The recruiting process typically ends when a student-athlete signs a National Letter of Intent (NLI) with a college or university. The NLI is a binding agreement between the student-athlete and the college or university that they will attend.<\/p>\n<h2>FAQs<\/h2>\n<h3>What is the difference between an official and unofficial visit?<\/h3>\n<p>An official visit is when a prospective student-athlete visits a college or university at the expense of the school. During an official visit, the student-athlete and their family can meet with coaches, tour the campus, and learn more about the school. An unofficial visit is when a prospective student-athlete visits a college or university at their own expense.<\/p>\n<h3>What is a verbal commitment?<\/h3>\n<p>A verbal commitment is when a prospective student-athlete verbally agrees to attend a college or university. However, it&#8217;s important to note that verbal commitments are non-binding and can be changed at any time.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the NCAA Eligibility Center?<\/h3>\n<p>The NCAA Eligibility Center is responsible for ensuring that prospective student-athletes meet the academic and athletic requirements to compete in college sports. Student-athletes must register with the NCAA Eligibility Center to be eligible to compete at the Division I or II level.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The NCAA recruiting calendar is an essential tool for college coaches and prospective student-athletes to navigate the complex world of college athletic recruitment. By following the rules outlined in the recruiting calendar, both coaches and student-athletes can ensure a fair and transparent recruitment process.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"2023 2024 and 2025 Recruiting Class Files for NCAA Football Etsy\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/i.etsystatic.com\/37762792\/r\/il\/467ba3\/4228899667\/il_794xN.4228899667_3xr1.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.etsy.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"2023 2024 and 2025 Recruiting Class Files for NCAA Football Etsy UK\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/i.etsystatic.com\/37762792\/r\/il\/3e151f\/4181246438\/il_794xN.4181246438_qkv4.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.etsy.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"20242025 Proposed\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/apps.weber.edu\/wsuimages\/registrar\/pictures\/2024-2025 Academic Calendar(1).png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.weber.edu<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Academic Calendars 2024\/2025 Free Printable PDF templates\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.calendarpedia.com\/images-large\/academic\/2024-2025-academic-calendar.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.calendarpedia.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"2 Year Calendar 2024 2025 2024 Calendar Printable\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.2024calendar.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/2024-2025-two-year-calendar-free-printable-excel-templates-2.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.2024calendar.net<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Academic Calendars 2024\/2025 Free Printable PDF templates\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.calendarpedia.com\/images-large\/academic\/2024-2025-academic-calendar-2p.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.calendarpedia.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Academic Calendars 2024\/2025 Free Printable PDF templates\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.calendarpedia.com\/images-large\/academic\/2024-2025-academic-calendar-rolling.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.calendarpedia.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Three year calendars for 2024, 2025 &amp; 2026 (UK) for Excel\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.calendarpedia.co.uk\/images-large\/three-year\/calendar-2024-2025-2026-uk.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.calendarpedia.co.uk<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Academic Calendars 2024\/2025 Free Printable PDF templates from www.calendarpedia.com Introduction The NCAA recruiting calendar is an important tool for college coaches and prospective student-athletes to navigate the&#8230; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/164"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=164"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/164\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=164"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
