Do you find it frustrating to delete each event individually? If so, you&#8217;re not alone. Many iPhone users face this issue and find it time-consuming. But don&#8217;t worry, there&#8217;s an easy solution to this problem. In this article, we&#8217;ll guide you through the steps to delete recurring events from your iPhone calendar for the year 2024. <\/p>\n<h2>Step-by-Step Guide<\/h2>\n<h3>Step 1: Open the Calendar App<\/h3>\n<p> The first step is to open the calendar app on your iPhone. You can find the calendar app on your home screen. Tap on the app to open it. <\/p>\n<h3>Step 2: Select the Recurring Event<\/h3>\n<p> Once you&#8217;ve opened the calendar app, select the recurring event that you want to delete. Tap on the event to open it. <\/p>\n<h3>Step 3: Tap on &#8220;Edit&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p> After opening the recurring event, tap on the &#8220;Edit&#8221; button located at the top right corner of the screen. <\/p>\n<h3>Step 4: Tap on &#8220;Delete Event&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p> Once you&#8217;ve tapped on the &#8220;Edit&#8221; button, scroll down the screen and tap on the &#8220;Delete Event&#8221; button. You&#8217;ll find this button located at the bottom of the screen. <\/p>\n<h3>Step 5: Choose &#8220;Delete This Event Only&#8221; or &#8220;Delete All Future Events&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p> After tapping on the &#8220;Delete Event&#8221; button, you&#8217;ll be prompted to choose between &#8220;Delete This Event Only&#8221; or &#8220;Delete All Future Events.&#8221; If you want to delete only the selected event, choose &#8220;Delete This Event Only.&#8221; If you want to delete all future events of the same series, choose &#8220;Delete All Future Events.&#8221; <\/p>\n<h3>Step 6: Tap on &#8220;Delete&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p> Once you&#8217;ve made your selection, tap on the &#8220;Delete&#8221; button to confirm the deletion of the event(s). <\/p>\n<h2>Question and Answer<\/h2>\n<h3>Q: Can I delete multiple recurring events at once?<\/h3>\n<p> A: Unfortunately, you can&#8217;t delete multiple recurring events at once. You&#8217;ll have to delete each event individually. <\/p>\n<h3>Q: Will deleting a recurring event delete all events in the series?<\/h3>\n<p> A: No, deleting a recurring event will only delete the selected event or all future events in the series, depending on your selection. <\/p>\n<h3>Q: Can I recover a deleted recurring event?<\/h3>\n<p> A: No, once you&#8217;ve deleted a recurring event, it&#8217;s gone for good. Make sure to double-check before deleting any events. <\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p> Deleting recurring events from your iPhone calendar for the year 2024 is easy and straightforward. Just follow the steps we&#8217;ve outlined in this article, and you&#8217;ll be able to delete any recurring event in no time. Remember, always double-check before deleting any events, as they can&#8217;t be recovered once deleted. <\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Delete Calendar Events on Your iPhone\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.iphonelife.com\/sites\/iphonelife.com\/files\/styles\/screenshot_iphone8_660_2x\/public\/image_from_ios_3_22.png?itok=3O93h6pJ\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.iphonelife.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to create, edit, and delete calendar events on your iPhone or iPad\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.imore.com\/sites\/imore.com\/files\/styles\/xlarge\/public\/field\/image\/2014\/06\/delete_calendar_event_iphone_ipad_howto2.jpg?itok=NNC4gW6T\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.imore.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Delete, Update or add event in iPhone calendar iOS 10 HowToiSolve\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.howtoisolve.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Manage-iPhone-calendar-event-by-Edit-Update-or-Delete-700x500.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.howtoisolve.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to add Facebook Events to iPhone calendar (and delete them too)\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/media.idownloadblog.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/delete-calendar-ios.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.idownloadblog.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to create, edit, and delete calendar events on your iPhone or iPad\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.imore.com\/sites\/imore.com\/files\/styles\/xlarge\/public\/field\/image\/2014\/06\/edit_calendar_event_iphone_update_howto.jpg?itok=oTj0J73U\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.imore.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Delete Calendar Event Iphone \/ How to Remove iPhone Calendar Virus How\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/media.idownloadblog.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/delete-spam-calendar-iPhone-events.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>ras-tafara.blogspot.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to create, edit, and delete calendar events on your iPhone or iPad\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.imore.com\/sites\/imore.com\/files\/styles\/mediumplus\/public\/field\/image\/2014\/06\/create_calendar_event_iphone_ipad_howto_2.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.imore.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Permanently Delete Calendars From iPhone\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.recover-iphone-ios-8.com\/images\/guide\/delete-calendar-iphone.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.recover-iphone-ios-8.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How to create, edit, and delete calendar events on your iPhone or iPad from www.imore.com Introduction Are you struggling to delete recurring events from your iPhone calendar&#8230; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/862"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=862"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/862\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=862"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
