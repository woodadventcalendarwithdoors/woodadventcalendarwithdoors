With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, Square Appointments is an ideal choice for businesses looking to streamline their appointment booking process. However, with so many people relying on Google Calendar to manage their schedules, it&#8217;s important to be able to sync Square Appointments with Google Calendar. In this article, we&#8217;ll take a look at how to do just that in 2024.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 1: Connect Your Google Account<\/h2>\n<p>The first step in syncing Square Appointments with Google Calendar is to connect your Google account to your Square account. To do this, log in to your Square account and navigate to the Appointments section. From there, click on the &#8220;Settings&#8221; tab and select &#8220;Integrations&#8221;. On the Integrations page, you&#8217;ll see an option to connect your Google account. Follow the prompts to log in to your Google account and grant Square permission to access your calendar.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 2: Choose Which Calendar to Sync<\/h2>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve connected your Google account to Square, you&#8217;ll need to choose which calendar you want to sync with. If you have multiple calendars in your Google account, you&#8217;ll need to select the one you want to use for Square appointments. To do this, go back to the Integrations page in Square Appointments and click on the &#8220;Edit&#8221; button next to the Google Calendar integration. From there, you&#8217;ll be able to choose which calendar to sync.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 3: Customize Your Sync Settings<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve connected your Google account and chosen which calendar to sync with, you&#8217;ll need to customize your sync settings. This is important to ensure that your Square appointments are synced correctly with your Google Calendar. In the Sync Settings section of the Integrations page in Square Appointments, you&#8217;ll be able to choose the time interval for syncing, as well as which types of appointments to sync. You can also choose to sync past appointments if you need to.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 4: Check Your Sync Status<\/h2>\n<p>After you&#8217;ve customized your sync settings, it&#8217;s important to check your sync status to make sure everything is working properly. In the Integrations section of Square Appointments, you&#8217;ll see a status icon next to the Google Calendar integration. If the icon is green, your sync is up-to-date. If it&#8217;s yellow or red, there may be a problem with your sync and you&#8217;ll need to troubleshoot.<\/p>\n<h2>Question and Answer<\/h2>\n<p>Q: Can I sync multiple Square accounts with one Google Calendar?<\/p>\n<p>A: Yes, you can connect multiple Square accounts to one Google Calendar. To do this, simply connect each Square account to the same Google account and choose the same calendar to sync with.<\/p>\n<p>Q: What happens if I delete an appointment in Square Appointments?<\/p>\n<p>A: If you delete an appointment in Square Appointments, it will be removed from your Google Calendar the next time the sync runs. However, if you delete an appointment in Google Calendar, it will not be removed from Square Appointments.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Syncing Square Appointments with Google Calendar is an easy and effective way to manage your business&#8217;s schedule.
